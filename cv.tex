\section*{Additional information} 
~~~~My research involves computationally intensive statistical methods. I apply these methods to models for 
clustered and longitudinal categorical data and medical image processing and analysis. My current research 
agenda focuses on the analysis of experimental medical imaging data.  
 
~~~~A specific focus of my research is the computation and application of statistical tools called multilevel models.  
This flexible class of statistical techniques, which includes linear mixed effect models, generalized- and non- 
linear mixed effect models and Bayesian models, are applicable to a nearly endless variety of scientific settings.  
In particular, I have applied these methods to social science data, general contingency table data, 
pharmacological data, brain imaging region of interest studies, voxel-by-voxel brain imaging studies, 
electroencephalogram data and sleep transition data. 
 
~~~~Of late, I have endeavored to focus my research on the application and 
computation of multilevel models to medical imaging data.  I have focused on nuclear medicine and brain 
imaging studies from modalities such as: positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed 
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging.   
 
~~~~My more theoretical work focuses on the computational aspects of these models and general computing 
algorithms. As such, I have worked on likelihood based marginalized models for categorical data, the 
expectation/maximization algorithm and Markov chain Monte Carlo.
