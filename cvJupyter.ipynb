    "## Summary\n",
    "Brian Caffo, PhD is a professor in the Department of Biostatistics with a secondary appointment in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. \n",
    "He graduated from the University of Florida Department of Statistics in 2001. He has worked in statistical computing, statistical modeling, computational statistics, multivariate and decomposition methods and statistics in neuroimaging and neuroscience. He led teams that won the ADHD 200 prediction competition. He co-directs the SMART statistical group. With other faculty at JHU, he created and co-directs the Coursera Data Science Specialization, a 10 course specialization on statistical data analysis. He co-directs the JHU Data Science Lab, a group dedicated to open educational innovation and data science. He is the former director of the Biostatistics graduate programs and admissions committees. He is currently the co-director of the Johns Hopkins High Performance Computing Exchange super computing service center and past-president of the Bloomberg School of Public Health faculty senate."
